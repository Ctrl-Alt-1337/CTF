# FLARE-On Challange 6 (Approach)

## Installing FlareVM

First off I installed [FlareVM](https://github.com/fireeye/flare-vm). Since I had no prior experience with CTF assignments I watched the playlist from [HacerSploit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKObRxxbOCQ&list=PLBf0hzazHTGMSlOI2HZGc08ePwut6A2Io).
